# Currency Converter

This is a Challenge app from Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course on Udemy.

This is my own solution without sneaking a preview from Jonas' solution.

The challenge uses the Frankfurter converter API
[https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?amount=10&from=GBP&to=USD](https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?amount=10&from=GBP&to=USD)

## Notes

I have applied some basic tailwindcss styles, but the focus is on pracising fetching data for learning purposes rather than aesthetics.
